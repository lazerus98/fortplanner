Working with Quickfort blueprints is fun but editing the CSVs is not.
I built a browser-based grid editor to make blueprint creation easier to approach.

It’s still evolving, but already usable for real fort layouts, stockpile setups, and repetitive room patterns.
If you use Quickfort a lot or want to start without fighting spreadsheets, give it a try.

Feedback, bug reports, and missing tokens welcome. I’m actively adding features from the Quickfort documentation, so if there’s something you want it to support, let me know.
