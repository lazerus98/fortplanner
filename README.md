Working with Quickfort blueprints is fun but editing the CSVs is not.
I built a browser-based grid editor to make blueprint creation easier to approach.

What it does:

    Works directly in your browser, nothing to install

    Visual tile grid for #dig, #build, #place, #zone, #burrow, #query

    Click-to-paint tools for most Quickfort tokens

    Support for multi-type stockpiles (e.g. yr, fS, etc.)

    Structured inputs for stockpile, zone, and burrow properties from the Quickfort appendix

    Exports clean .csv files you can drop straight into your DFHack blueprints folder

    Imports existing blueprints for editing

    Keeps dig/build/place dimensions in sync

It’s still evolving, but already usable for real fort layouts, stockpile setups, and repetitive room patterns.
If you use Quickfort a lot or want to start without fighting spreadsheets, give it a try.

Feedback, bug reports, and missing tokens welcome. I’m actively adding features from the Quickfort documentation, so if there’s something you want it to support, let me know.
